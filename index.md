# Mission

As a full stack software engineer, I always believe my ultimate goal is to make a perfect product. Sometimes, it's like a dream that's not something I can achieve in the short term, but I will keep pursuing it in my life. I love technologies. I love the world. No matter where I am, in my hometown China or relocated to the US，I wish I can use technologies to make the world a little bit better. No matter how my life evolves, this mission remains constant.
